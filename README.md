# Less UPS

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This mod attempts to simulate setting game speed to 2 without actually setting it. Thus saving UPS.
It is aimed at players who are getting lower UPS because their factory is too big for their computer.  
It is meant to be played with game speed 0.5  `/c game.speed=0.5`
